        <h1>Mathematics: Concrete or Abstract?</h1>

            Mathematics is often seen as an immense abstraction by its detractors - and some zealots. However, Mathematical abstractions exist only because of concrete ideas, and often even physical matter. Without the necessity for humans to travel we would never have come up with the idea of distance, and the triangle inequality that naturally follows from this notion. Without computers the Mandelbrot set would never have been discovered. Without advances in computing hardware and algorithmic techniques, Adrien Douady, and John H. Hubbard might have spent many years thinking that the Mandelbrot set was not connected simply because they could not produce graphs of high enough detail.
            The late and great Vladimir Arnold had some strong ideas about the zealots of abstraction - he paints an image of French students who can quickly churn out lemmas in algebraic geometry yet are not even the faintest familiar with the elliptic curve, or the topological classification of surfaces. I believe as well that the damage that the Bourbaki group has done to the study of Mathematics is immense. What is not at issue however is the separation of Mathematics from physics as Arnold suggests. Mathematics is fun precisely because it is an intellectual pursuit that does not always have to be tied to concrete purposes or exact fields. Abstraction allows people to quickly handle problems in every possible domain, concrete or abstract. A mathematician can do computer science, can help figure out the optimal way to plan a city in a certain space, can do physics, a mathematician can do anything they want!
            The history and movement of scientific thought can be summarised succinctly as “From the concrete to the abstract, and from the abstract to the concrete.” What Mathematics education and thinking so deeply needs is this movement.

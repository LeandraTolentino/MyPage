    <h1>My Favourite Books</h1>

    <div class="book">
        <h2>Introduction to Commutative Algebra</h2>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Michael Atiyah</p>
        <p>A thoroughly comprehensive book on commutative algebra written by one of the greatest algebraicists. I had a huge amount of fun solving dozens of problems from this book during Christmas holidays.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book">
        <h2>Economics: The User's Guide</h2>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Ha-Joon Chang</p>
        <p>My favourite book written by my favourite writer! This book reveals how complicated economics is, revealing all the various issues and solutions posed by schools over the years, such as those by Schumpeter and Keynes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book">
        <h2>The Wages of Destruction</h2>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Adam Tooze</p>
        <p>When I was really young I was deeply fascinated by 20th century conflicts. This book was commonly recommended by historians for those who wish to understand the economy of Germany during WW2, and how its rush for various resources influenced its decisions.</p>
